          I have implemented an authentication system(main features - singup, login and index page ) using html css and js in
          which i am using local storage as my database (to store user information) and cockies(session authentication). 
          There are three pages singup and login page and index page ( home page).To acsess index page user must be 
          authenticated.This project using local storage for storeing userid and userspassward in array form and also
          storing cockies in cockies I am storing login data .
          
          Using this project because I don't know much about database that's why I am using local storage.
